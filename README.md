# MOAR accessible charts
This repo is a place to explore accessible charting. The examples are generally proofs-of-concept (POC) only, and are experimental.

## gpt-summary
This project explores using [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) to summarize pricing data for Apple, Inc. (AAPL). It also draws an SVG chart using the excellent [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) library.
